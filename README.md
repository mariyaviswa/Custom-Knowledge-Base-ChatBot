## 🚀 Project Objective

The Custom Knowledge Base Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot that enables users to query uploaded documents (PDFs, text files, DOCX) dynamically. By leveraging LangChain and Large Language Models (LLMs), it provides context-aware and relevant responses based on document contents.

## 🏆 Key Features

✅ Document Upload & Processing – Users can upload PDFs, TXT, or DOCX files, and the chatbot extracts key information for querying.

✅ LLM-Powered Responses – Utilizes GPT-3.5/4 (Groq) and Hugging Face models for intelligent answers.

✅ Text Chunking & Embeddings – Converts large documents into searchable vector representations using OpenAI or Hugging Face embeddings.

✅ Interactive Web UI – Built with Chainlit, providing a user-friendly interface.

✅ Scalability & Flexibility – Can integrate with other vector stores, APIs, and local LLMs for better control.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

🔹 LangChain – Framework for integrating LLMs with memory and vector search.

🔹 LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo/GPT-4, Hugging Face Models) – To generate intelligent responses.

🔹 OpenAI Embeddings / Hugging Face Transformers – Converts text into vector representations for semantic search.

🔹 Chainlit – User-friendly web interface for chatbot interaction.

🔹 Python – Core programming language for data processing and document handling.

## 🎯 Use Cases

🔹 Corporate Knowledge Management – Automates document search for businesses.🔹 Education & Research – Summarizes and explains academic papers efficiently.🔹 Customer Support – Enables instant, knowledge-driven support.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

✅ Real-time Document Updates – Dynamically update the knowledge base.

✅ Multi-language Support – Translate and process documents in various languages.

✅ Voice Input/Output – Enable speech-based queries and responses.

✅ Offline Mode – Run chatbot locally without an internet connection.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

🟢 LLMs from Groq

🟢 LangChain – As a Framework for LLM

## 🛠 System Requirements

🔹 Python 3.10+ (Older versions may not compile)🔹 Git – For cloning the repository

## ⚙️ Steps to Replicate

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariyaviswa/Workcohol_Intern_Project.git
cd langchain-groq-chainlit
```

## 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment & Activate It
#### Create
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
#### Activate
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)

Rename example.env to .env and configure it with your LangSmith API Key and Groq API Key.

cp example.env .env

🔹 Create an account on LangSmith and obtain API keys.🔹 Get your Groq API Key from Groq's API Key Page.

## Add the following details in your .env file:

```bash
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true

LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"

LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"

LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your-project"

GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
```

## 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5️⃣ Run the Chatbot UI

```bash
chainlit run langchain_groq_chainlit.py
```
